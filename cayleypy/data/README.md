Pre-computed results:
* Growth function for Cayley graph for S_n with different generators:
  `lrx_cayley_growth`, `top_spin_cayley_growth`.  
  Note that initial state doesn't matter here.
* Growth function for Schreier coset graphs for different generators and different 
  initial states: `lrx_coset_growth`, `top_spin_coset_growth`.
